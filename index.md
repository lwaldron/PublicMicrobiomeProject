## Abstract

Abstract Dysbiosis of the host microbiome is now recognized as a
hallmark of cancer and a factor in the systemic response to
immunotherapy. While a large volume of literature and data resources
on microbiome research are available, systemic comparison and analysis
are limited due to the heterogeneity in data and reporting schema. To
enable rapid and cost-effective elucidation of the roles of
microorganisms in the etiology and progression of cancer, we have
developed high-quality harmonized databases of public microbiome data
and microbial signatures. This proposal expands and creates new
features of these microbiome databases through four aims. First, it
will enhance the analytic scope of BugSigDB, a Semantic Mediawiki for
manual curation and review of microbial signatures by incorporating
microbial physiologies and morphologies, predicted metabolic
functions, automatic identification of similar signatures, and
creation of user-friendly Bug Set Enrichment Analysis
workflows. Second, it will establish the next generation of
curatedMetagenomicData, a microbiome database of large-scale manual
curation and uniformly processed shotgun sequencing data, supporting
FAIR principles. We will create a federated, ontology-based curation
system and distributed computing metagenomic profiling workflow, both
applicable to all Sequence Read Archive (SRA) records. Third, it will
expand curatedMetagenomicData and BugSigDB with data from thousands of
published studies and perform meta-analyses using these
resources. Lastly, we will mobilize hundreds of data curators from
diverse backgrounds by participating in established internship
programs and mobilize the microbiome research community to adopt
reporting standards for publication. This contribution is significant
because it increases the likelihood of developing effective public
health interventions to prevent and detect microbiota-linked cancers
by providing methods for improved mechanistic interpretation of
microbiome studies, extracting new information from published raw
metagenomic shotgun sequencing data and metadata, and enabling re-use
of existing data by a much broader range of researchers and
methodologies. The proposed research is innovative because it
identifies and corrects important deficiencies in how microbiome data
are published, increasing the utility of public data and published
results on a large scale by other research teams.

## Public Health Relevance

The human microbiome is implicated in the development and response to
treatment of some cancers, including infectious agents estimated to be
responsible for ~20% of the global cancer burden. However, previously
unrecognized bacterial and viral strains, as well as loss of normal
structure and function of human-associated microbiomes, likely play
additional roles in disease etiology and treatment. This project
investigates the role of the human microbiome in cancer by applying
novel and state-of-the-art methods to published metagenomic data, and
provides enhanced, expanded, and more efficiently usable microbiome
data resources back to the cancer research community for a broad range
of investigations.
